<DT>Abstract
</DT>
                
<DD>
In the case of an OSGi Gateway in a moving vehicle, applications may want
to use the position of the vehicle. This RFP provides an overview of what 
common position-dependent applications need to know, and it discusses the
capabilities a position device and a position service should offer.

<DT>                  Introduction
                
</DT>
                
<DD>
The Position API provides a standard approach both for position information
providers as well as for position information consumers.

<DT>                  Motivation and Rational (Optional)
                
</DT>
                
<DD>
The activity of many in-vehicle applications is dependent on the location
of the vehicle. Common examples are navigation services, fleet management and
relevant traffic information. All applications that need position information
should have a common approach in order to retrieve this position information.
On the other hand, different devices delivering position information may
exist. A Position API defines how applications can retrieve position 
information and how devices should deliver position information.

<DT>                  Technical Discussion
                
</DT>
                
<DD>
The Position API has to provide a Service that can be used to
<UL>
<LI>retrieve the current position of the vehicle
<LI>retrieve additional information in case this information is available
<LI>obtain the accuracy of the delivered information
</UL>
A Position Service receives its information from one or many Position Devices.
Different Position Devices exist, each with their own specifications. 
The Position API defines a generic Position Device that provides information
towards a Position Service.
Applications that are interested in position information should be able to
register this interest. Therefore, the Position Service has to provide 
a white board approach.

<DT>                  Security Considerations
                
</DT>
                
<DD>
Not all applications should have access to the Position Service. The
OSGi Framework Security Model can be used to restrict access to the 
Position Service.
