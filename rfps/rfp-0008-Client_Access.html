<h4>
<b>Status of this Memo</b></h4>

<dl>
<dt>
This document suggests the following extension to the OSGi specification
and requests discussion. Distribution of this document is unlimited.&nbsp;</dt>

<h4>
Abstract&nbsp;</h4>
The purpose of a gateway is to provide services to end users. A mechanism
is needed to allow these end users to view information in the gateway,
modify configuration information, receive notifications and in interact
with the services in a uniform way. This RFP seeks solutions in this area.&nbsp;
<h4>
Introduction&nbsp;</h4>
An OSGi gateway will be connected to many different devices in a household.
These devices will be able to communicate among each other and to services
reachable over the internet. For example ServiceSpace and the Device API
will take care of most these communication issues. These APIs and services
are about machine-machine interaction and leave the end user out of the
picture.&nbsp;
<br>However, the users of the gateway play an important role. It can be
expected that users will require the following interactions:&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
Receive notifications</li>

<li>
View information of a service</li>

<li>
Input information to a service</li>
</ol>

<h4>
Terminology</h4>
A <i>user</i> is a person seeking access to the gateway.&nbsp;
<br>A <i>role</i> is a principal that acts as a user but can be filled
by a group of users.&nbsp;
<br>A <i>device</i> is a machine connected to the gateway in some way.
E.g. a PDA, cell phone or web browser. This device will be represented
in the gateway by a <i>proxy</i>.&nbsp;
<br>A <i>publisher</i> is a service that has information for a user.&nbsp;
<h4>
Technical Discussion</h4>

<ol>
<li>
The API should fit in the standard OSGi environment as described in [1]
and [2].</li>

<li>
API's based on standard javax APIs (like for example the Servlet API) are
preferable.</li>

<li>
The API should provide a framework for publishing that minimizes the work
for the bundle writer.</li>

<li>
A central registry of information should be possible.</li>

<li>
A mechanism needs to be provided where a user can persistently store a
reference to a piece of information. E.g. a bookmark.</li>

<li>
Publishers must be able to publish information in a simple way without
any knowledge whatsoever of the actual devices present.</li>

<li>
Notifications must be associated with a priority that supports at least
3 levels: NORMAL, URGENT, ALARM.</li>

<li>
The user must be able to react on information from a service and provide
values.</li>

<li>
There should be a query mechanism where a service can post a query. This
query should be answered by a user as soon as possible.</li>

<li>
Support data format negotiation. Devices will have widely different capabilities.
E.g. some device like a pager or a cell phone can only display a single
line of text. Other devices like a web browser on a iMac can show rich
text and graphics.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
A publisher must be able to publish information for specific users or roles.</li>

<li>
A publisher must be able to optimize the information depending on the capabilities
of the device.</li>

<li>
Each user can be associated with 0 or more devices.</li>

<li>
Each device can be associated with 0 or more users.</li>

<li>
Proxies must be able to optimize the cost based on: user profile, urgency
of information, presence of other devices, the life time of unread information.</li>

<li>
A role can be filled by 0 or more users</li>

<li>
Proxies must authenticate their users with the help of a system component.</li>

<li>
User authentication mechanisms should be extendable, however should at
least support password authentication.</li>

<li>
Publishers should not require any secure information from the user for
authentication purpose.</li>

<li>
Proxies should not be able to fake the authentication of a role or user.</li>
</ol>

<h4>
Security Considerations&nbsp;</h4>

<dt>
The client access API is very vulnerable. Through this API, any service
can get access to critical information from any other service and modify
its operational parameters. Therefore it is crucial that the RFC will propose
a mechanism where the publisher will not have to trust the proxy and where
the proxy will not have to trust the publisher. E.g. a mechanism where
a publisher has to "trust" a proxy to have authenticated a user is not
acceptable. Also not acceptable is that the proxy must hand over credentials
to the publisher to proof its user. This would allow a publisher to get
its hands on credentials and use it for other purposes.</dt>
