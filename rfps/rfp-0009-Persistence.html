<DT>                  Abstract
                
</DT>
                
<DD>
                  Many of the services running on the Open Service Gateway will need to store and retrieve information that persists beyond the life of the service, and that can be shared by other services. Rather than each of these services writing code to efficiently read and write information to a file system, and recover from error, we want to have a common persistence service that can be used by other services to store and retrieve information persistently. This RFP provides some general goals and guidelines and solicits technical submissions that will lead to defining a Persistence Service API for the Open Service Gateway.

<DT>                  Introduction
                
</DT>
                
<DD>
                  Many of the services running on the Service Gateway, be it a high level service such as the home security system or a system level service such as Log Service (RFP 003) will need to write information to a persistent store so that the same or different service can access this information at a later time. Some of these services may need this persistent information to be backed up on a server machine (perhaps managed by an operator).

<DT>    Motivation              

                
</DT>
                
<DD>
                  A common approach to make information persist is to write it out to a file. However, a file system provides only limited service for persistence leaving the service developer to write a lot of code just to store and retrieve the information efficienty and be able to synchronize this information with a server machine. Also a file system is operating system dependent and thus is not portable.

We need an API for the services to be able to make any piece of information persistent, be able to search the persistent information store using a high level query language, be able to recover from failure after partial updates, and be able to synchronize the data with a server database.

The benefits of this API will be smaller code size and better quality code for the services using this API.

<DT>                  Technical Discussion
                
</DT>
                
<DD>
The Persistence Service must provide the following capabilities.

<li> Ability to organize information as a set of tables (SQL model) or a set of Java classes.
<li> Ability to use a high level query language to search for required information.
<li> Ability to create indexes to speed up searches.
<li> Ability to download data from a server database and synchronize changes made to the persistent store with the server database.
<li> Ability to create a session for a given user who is already authenticated by the Security Service.
<li> Ability to rollback partial updates made to the persistent store within a session.
<li> Ability to enforce access authorization based on the user's privileges (optional). 
<li> Ability to support retrieval of persistent information with a small number of instructions.

<DT>                  Security Considerations
                
</DT>
                
<DD>
                  The Persistence Service will assume the existence of Security Service which will be responsible for authenticating the user or service that is requesting a persistence service. If the security service does not provide access control, then the persistent service will support authorization service to control access to persistent information. Encryption of data downloaded from/synchronized with the server database is implementation-defined.
