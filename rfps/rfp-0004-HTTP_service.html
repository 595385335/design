<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Java HTTP Service RFP</H2>
<H3>Status of this Memo </H3>
<P>This document suggests the following extension to the OSGi specification for the Open Services Gateway Initiative, and requests discussion. Distribution of this document is unlimited. 
<P>
<H3>Abstract </H3>
<P>A highly useful and desirable service to operate in the Open Services Gateway Initiative Services Framework[1] is an HTTP Service which will provide a Java API to allow Java programs running in the Framework to register Java Servlets and other resources so that they may be accessible via the HTTP protocol. This RFP provides some general goals and guidelines and solicits technical submissions that will lead to defining an HTTP Service API for the Services Framework. 
<P>
<H3>Acknowledgment </H3>
<P>The author wants to acknowledge the contributions of the members of the Connected Alliance and OSGi.&nbsp; 
<P>
<H3>Introduction </H3>
<P>The HTTP Service API defines the set of capabilities needed for the dynamic registration and unregistration of Java Servlets and other resources by Java programs written to run in the Services Framework. 
<P>
<H3>Motivation and Rational </H3>
<P>Devices running the Services Framework will need a simple protocol to allow communication with other devices and renders. A service which supports the ubiquitous HTTP protocol and the Java Servlet programming model will allow Java programs written to run on the Services Framework to provide a user interface that may be rendered on the same or different device by a rendering program, such as a web browser. 
<P>
<H3>Technical Discussion </H3>
<P>The HTTP Service must provide, at a minimum, the following capabilities and features: 
	<UL TYPE="disc">
		<LI>Java Servlet API (a.k.a. &quot;servlet.jar&quot;) which provides the definition of the Java Servlet API Java interfaces and classes at the Java Servlet 2.1 API[2] specification level. 
		<LI>Java Servlet Engine which provides the runtime environment (and thus the implementation of the Java Servlet API) for Java Servlets which conform to the Java Servlet 2.1 API. 
		<LI>Support for HTTP/1.0[3] or HTTP/1.1[4] protocol. HTTP/1.0 is a &quot;smaller&quot; protocol and thus is more suited for embedded devices. Implementations of the HTTP/1.0 protocol may wish to consider supporting the Keep-Alive feature of HTTP/1.1 as a performance enhancement. 
		<LI>Java API to allow Java programs written to run in the Services Framework to dynamically register and unregister Java Servlets and other resources into the URI namespace of the HTTP Service.
		<LI>Java API to allow Java programs written to run in the Services Framework to control the HTTP authentication for access to registered Java Servlets and resources.
	</UL>

<H3>Security Considerations </H3>
<P>As a request for specification proposals, this document has no direct security considerations.&nbsp; However, the resulting HTTP Service API may undergo a security review before approval of the API.
