<h2>
Java Log Service RFP</h2></center>

<h3>
Status of this Memo</h3>
This document suggests the following extension to the OSGi specification
for the Open Services Gateway Initiative, and requests discussion. Distribution
of this document is unlimited.
<h3>
Abstract</h3>
A key component of the Open Services Gateway Initiative Services Framework[1]
is a Log Service which will provide a Java API to allow Java programs running
in the Framework to write information to the log and also to read entries
from the log. This RFP provides some general goals and guidelines and solicits
technical submissions that will lead to defining a Log Service API for
the Services Framework.
<h3>
Acknowledgment</h3>
The author wants to acknowledge the contributions of the members of the
Connected Alliance and OSGi.
<h3>
Introduction</h3>
The Log Service API defines the set of capabilities needed to allow Java
programs written to run in the Services Framework to write entries to the
log containing various information and for entries to be read from the
log.
<h3>
Motivation and Rational</h3>
For diagnostic and reliability purposes, Java programs written to run on
the Services Framework will wish to write information to a log that can
be examined, if necessary, for problem determination.
<h3>
Technical Discussion</h3>
The Log Service must provide, at a minimum, the following capabilities
and features:
<ul TYPE="disc">
<li>
Ability to record the system time in a log entry.</li>

<li>
Ability to record severity levels in a log entry.</li>

<li>
Ability to record a text message in a log entry.</li>

<li>
Ability to record a Java Throwable object in a log entry.</li>

<li>
Ability to record the identity of the Java program running in the Services
Framework that is related to a log entry.</li>

<li>
The Log Service must provide the ability to read entries from the log by
enumeration and/or subscription.</li>

<li>
The Log Service must capture and convert Services Framework events into
log entries.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Security Considerations</h3>
As a request for specification proposals, this document has no direct security
considerations.&nbsp; However, the resulting Log Service API may undergo
a security review before approval of the API.
