Abstract&nbsp;</dt>

<dd>
A key component of the Open Services Gateway initiative is an open framework
that defines the service execution environment for vendor and 3rd party
services.&nbsp; This RFP provides some general goals and guidelines and
solicits technical submissions that will lead to defining a Java service
framework API.</dd>

Introduction&nbsp;</dt>

<dd>
The Java services framework API defines a basic set of capabilities needed
to deploy and operate independently developed services within an open services
gateway context. The gateway device will&nbsp; typically be installed,
operated and maintained by an OSG operator and will run a set of 3rd party
services bundled together by a service aggregator.&nbsp; The service framework
must support the deployment of services to resource constrained devices
and must provide sufficient security to prevent unauthorized interactions
between services. The defined framework should leverage as best possible
existing Java APIs, tools, and techniques.</dd>

<dt>
&nbsp;</dt>

<dd>
While service framework APIs for other languages and runtime environments
may be useful in the future, this RFP is focused explicitly only on a Java
language API.</dd>

<dd>
&nbsp;</dd>

<dt>
Technical Discussion&nbsp;</dt>

<dd>
The services framework API must provide, at a minimum, the following capabilities
and features:</dd>

<ul>
<li>
Complete life cycle management of securely deploying services, including
the ability to suspend operation and dynamically update installed software.</li>

<li>
Mechanisms to allow services to be downloaded when needed and the memory&nbsp;
reclaimed when the service is no longer used.</li>

<li>
Simple query mechanism for locating and using services that are running
within a single gateway device.</li>

<li>
Security of service interactions within a single gateway device.</li>

<li>
Local administration of services.</li>

<li>
Mechanisms to describe the required runtime environment.</li>

<li>
Mechanisms to declare dependencies on other services, packages, and native
code libraries.</li>

<li>
Protected, persistent storage area for storing configuration information.</li>

<li>
Standardized mechanism for configuring services.</li>

<li>
Mechanisms to enable an off-line check of package dependencies to support
preload determination of program footprint by a service aggregator.&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Support for service aggregators that can resell rebundle services developed
by 3rd parties.</li>
</ul>

<dd>
Additional feature and capability requirements may be found in the Market
Requirements document currently being developed.&nbsp; Other attributes
and capabilities of the services framework API may be defined during the
course of the development of the API specification.</dd>

<dt>
Security Considerations&nbsp;</dt>

<dd>
As a request for technical proposals, this document has no direct security
considerations.&nbsp; However, the resulting services framework API will
significantly impact the security of services running within a gateway
and a security review is needed before approval of the API.</dd>
