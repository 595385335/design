<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Services Framework Remote Administration RFP</H2>
<H3>Status of this Memo </H3>
<P>This document suggests the following extension to the OSGi specification for the Open Services Gateway Initiative, and requests discussion. Distribution of this document is unlimited.
<P>
<H3>Abstract </H3>
<P>A key aspect of the Open Services Gateway Initiative Services Framework[1] is the ability to administrate the framework under the control of a remote managing system. This RFP provides some general goals and guidelines and solicits technical submissions that will lead to defining an administration capability and API for the Services Framework.
<P>
<H3>Acknowledgment </H3>
<P>The author wants to acknowledge the contributions of the members of the Connected Alliance and OSGi.&nbsp;
<P>
<H3>Introduction </H3>
<P>The Remote Administration API enables a managing system to remotely manage and configure the bundles and services on a target device.
<P>
<H3>Motivation and Rational </H3>
<P>The primary goal of the Remote Administration API is to remotely manage and configure bundles and services on a target device.  The Remote Administration API should meet this goal as follows.  First, it should provide a consistent application programming interface (API) to use during development of device management applications.  Second, it should provide the flexibility for implementors to "plug-in" different device management protocols below the Remote Administration API.
<P>
<P>Another goal of the Remote Administration API is to enable implementors to deploy implementations in a variety of devices; the different hardware characteristics of the devices affect the amount of code that can run on these devices.  Therefore, the Remote Administration API should require a minimum of components on the managed device; however, an implementor has the flexibility to utilize additional components in devices that can accommodate these components.
<P>
<H3>Technical Discussion </H3>
<P>Administration of the Services Framework must provide, at a minimum, the following capabilities and features:
<P>
<UL TYPE="disc">
	<LI>Remotely administer the Services Framework
	<LI>Remotely configure services on a managed device.
	<LI>Minimize the software requirements for a managed device.
        <ul>
	<LI>The framework should only require the Java profile[2] for the Services Framework.
	<LI>Enable services to share common configuration properties.
        </ul>
      	<LI>Scalable for mass deployment and configuration.
        <ul>
      	<LI>Services must be remotely configurable without a user interface.
      	<LI>Services may be remotely configurable with a user interface.
      	<LI>Enables configuration of services when the Services Framework on the target device is down or unavailable.
      	<LI>Enables an administrator to configure properties en masse for groups of devices.
      	<LI>Does not require downloading of communication classes from every managed device.
        </ul>
      	<LI>Upward compatible.
        <ul>
      	<LI>De-couples the configuration state from services.
      	<LI>Does not require serialization because a serialized object might not be compatible with all current or future JVM's.
        </ul>
      	<LI>Protocol neutral.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Security Considerations </H3>
<P>As a request for specification proposals, this document has no direct security considerations.&nbsp; However, the resulting Administration capability and API should undergo a security review before approval of the API.
