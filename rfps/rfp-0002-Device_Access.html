Abstract&nbsp;</dt>

<dd>
A key component of the Open Services Gateway initiative is an open framework
that defines how services access devices attached to the gateway, either
directly or via a local network..&nbsp; This RFP provides some general
goals and guidelines and solicits technical submissions that will lead
to defining a Java-based device access API.</dd>

Introduction&nbsp;</dt>

<dd>
The device framework Java API defines a basic set of capabilities needed
for on-demand dynamically loaded services for devices, appliances and network
hardware attached to an open service gateway.&nbsp; Examples of such devices
include security systems, sensors, coffee makers, remotely controlled appliances,
TV set top boxes, and personal computers.&nbsp; The API must support both
devices attached directly to the gateway and devices accessed from the
gateway via a local communications network.&nbsp; The API must not require
any specific network architecture and must work with a diverse set of wired
and wireless local network technologies.&nbsp; The device APIs&nbsp; must
work in&nbsp; resource constrained devices and should leverage as best
possible existing Java APIs, tools, and techniques.</dd>

<dt>
&nbsp;</dt>

<dd>
While device access APIs for other languages and runtime environments may
be useful in the future, this RFP is focused explicitly only on a Java
language API running in conjunction with a services framework API [1].</dd>

<dt>
&nbsp;</dt>

<dd>
&nbsp;</dd>

<dt>
Technical Discussion&nbsp;</dt>

<dd>
The device framework Java API must provide, at a minimum, the following
capabilities and features:</dd>

<ul>
<li>
On-demand loading of device and network services using the services framework
Java API.</li>

<li>
Independence from any specific network architecture.</li>

<li>
Compatible with any of the emerging local networking standards, including
HomeRF and Bluetooth.</li>

<li>
Independence from any specific device characteristics.</li>

<li>
Automatic addition and deletion of devices when supported by the underlying
communication mechanisms.</li>

<li>
Manual configuration of legacy local networks and their attached devices.</li>
</ul>

<dd>
Additional feature and capability requirements may be found in the Market
Requirements document currently being developed.&nbsp; Other attributes
and capabilities of the device access API may be defined during the course
of the development of the API specification.</dd>

<dt>
Security Considerations&nbsp;</dt>

<dd>
As a request for technical proposals, this document has no direct security
considerations.&nbsp; However, the resulting device access API may significantly
impact the security of services running within a gateway and a security
review is needed before approval of the API.</dd>
