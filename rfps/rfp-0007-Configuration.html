<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Services Framework Configuration RFP</H2>
<H3>Status of this Memo </H3>
<P>This document suggests the following extension to the OSGi specification for the Open Services Gateway Initiative, and requests discussion. Distribution of this document is unlimited.
<P>
<H3>Abstract </H3>
<P>A key aspect of the Open Services Gateway Initiative Services Framework[1] is the ability to configure the services on the device.  This RFP provides some general goals and guidelines and solicits technical submissions that will lead to defining a configuration capability and API that programs can use to get and set configuration properties.
<P>
<H3>Acknowledgment </H3>
<P>The author wants to acknowledge the contributions of the members of the Connected Alliance and OSGi.&nbsp;
<P>
<H3>Introduction </H3>
<P>The Configuration API enables a program to get and set configuration properties on a device.
<H3>Motivation and Rational </H3>
<P>The primary goal of the Configuration API is to enable services to get and set configuration properties.  The Configuration API should meet this goal as follows.  First, it should provide a consistent application programming interface (API) to use during development of programs.  Second, it should provide the flexibility for implementors to "plug-in" different persistent storage mechanisms below the Configuration API.
<P>
<P><FONT SIZE="3">A typical product will be composed of many programs and services. If a product is re-designed in a future version and split into a different set of programs and services, the configuration state should still be usable.  Therefore,</FONT> another goal of the Configuration API is to de-couple programs and services from configuration.<FONT SIZE="3"><BR CLEAR="LEFT">
</FONT>
<H3>Technical Discussion </H3>
<P>Configuration Services must provide, at a minimum, the following capabilities and features:
<P>
<UL TYPE="disc">
	<LI>Enable services to get and set configuration properties.
	<LI>Support notification of events for property changes (e.g. insertion, removal, update)
	<LI>Support the Java String, int, long, byte[], byte, and boolean property types.
	<LI>Minimize the software requirements for a managed device.
        <ul>
	<LI>The API should only require the Java profile[2] for the Services Framework.
	<LI>Enable services to share common configuration properties.
	<LI>Does not require serialization
        </ul>
	<LI>De-couples the configuration state, storage location, medium, format and policies from services.
</UL>
<H3></H3>
<H3>Security Considerations </H3>
<P>As a request for specification proposals, this document has no direct security considerations.&nbsp; However, the resulting Configuration capability and API should undergo a security review before approval of the API.
