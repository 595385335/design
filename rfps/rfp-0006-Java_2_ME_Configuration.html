Status of this Memo&nbsp;</dt>

<dd>
This document suggests the following improvement to the OSGi specification
for the Open Services Gateway Initiative, and requests discussion. Distribution
of this document is unlimited.&nbsp;</dd>

Abstract&nbsp;</dt>

<dd>
An important target for OSGi implementations is constrained resource devices
where the Java 2 Micro Edition technology is more appropriate than the
full PersonalJava environment. This RFP provides some general goals and
guidelines and solicits technical submissions that will lead to either
selecting one of the predefined J2ME configurations (such as limited or
connected device) or defining a new J2ME configuration specific for OSGi.</dd>

<dt>
&nbsp;</dt>

<dd>
&nbsp;</dd>

<dt>
Introduction&nbsp;</dt>

<dd>
To promote the portability of 3rd party services amongst independently
developed implementations of the OSGi specification, it is necessary to
specify the minimum Java execution environment that can be assumed available
on any OSGi platform.&nbsp; The Java 2 Micro Edition technology has the
smallest resource requirements of any standard Java environment and is
upwards compatible with other Java runtime environments such as PersonalJava
and desktop and enterprise versions of Java.&nbsp; Thus some form of J2ME
is an appropriate base.&nbsp;</dd>

<dt>
&nbsp;</dt>

<dd>
&nbsp;</dd>

<dt>
Technical Discussion&nbsp;</dt>

<dd>
The J2ME architecture is modular and scalable and supports the kind of
flexible deployment needed by the OSGi gateway market. While the KVM of
J2ME is targeted at devices containing 16- or 32-bit processors and a total
memory footprint of approximately 256K bytes, the KVM can be deployed flexibly
to address a range of trade-offs between space and functionality. In addition,
J2ME provides a range of virtual machine technologies, each optimized for
different processor types and memory footprints.</dd>

<dt>
&nbsp;</dt>

<dd>
The J2ME architecture defines a small core API which must be fully implemented
in every J2ME compatible device. Beyond the core, J2ME can be deployed
in several configurations. Each configuration addresses a particular "class"
of device and specifies a set of APIs and Java virtual machine features
that users and content providers can assume are present on those devices.
Application developers and content providers must design their code to
stay within the bounds of the Java virtual machine features and APIs specified
by that configuration. In this way, interoperability can be guaranteed
among the various applications and devices in a particular class.</dd>

<dt>
&nbsp;</dt>

<dd>
Sun and the Java community is in the process of defining two standard J2ME
configurations, one for connected devices (JSR-000036)[1] and one for limited
connectivity devices (JSR-000030)[2].&nbsp; The JSR and CAFE for Limited,
Connected Devices is closed.&nbsp; The JSR comment period for JSR-000036
has closed and the call for experts is expected soon.&nbsp; While it is
too early to determine if either of these configurations will be suitable
for OSGi, picking a standard configuration is highly desirable in terms
of exploiting the larger installed developer base that comes from using
a standard configuration.</dd>

<dt>
&nbsp;</dt>

<dd>
Participants in this effort are expected to keep apprised of, and possibly
participate in, the work of defining the standard Connected Device J2ME
configuration.</dd>

<dt>
&nbsp;</dt>

<dd>
The OSGi adopted Java 2 Micro Edition configuration should provide the
following:</dd>

<ul>
<li>
Smallest practical memory footprint.</li>

<li>
Suitably rich environment for bundle developers.</li>

<li>
Support for service aggregators that can resell rebundle services developed
by 3rd parties.</li>

<li>
Support the packages defined as required in the OSGi profile.&nbsp; Required
packages may include the service framework, device access,&nbsp; remote
administration and others.</li>

<li>
Provide sufficient JDK 1.2 security classes to provide the required gateway
security.</li>
</ul>

<dd>
Additional feature and capability requirements may be found in the Market
Requirements document currently being developed.&nbsp;</dd>

<dt>
&nbsp;</dt>

<dd>
&nbsp;</dd>

<dt>
Security Considerations&nbsp;</dt>

<dd>
As a request for technical proposals, this document has no direct security
considerations.&nbsp; However, the resulting runtime environment will contain
security APIs that will impact the security of services running within
a gateway and a security review is needed before approval of the configuration.</dd>
